# Sales-Forecasting

This project is aimed at utilising a Machine Learning algorithm CatBoost from RemixAutoML package in R, on a time series data. 
The data gives us weekly sales of every department of every store of Walmart from (2010-02-05 to 2012-10-26). The data is taken from
Kaggle Competition 2014. 

We can use Machine learning to forecast sales of each department of every store. Another application of this code on Sales forecasting 
could be SKU level forecasts.
